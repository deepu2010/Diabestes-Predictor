# Diabetes-Predictor
I designed a diabetes prediction machine learning model using K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm. My Machine Learning model is 82 % accurate

# About the dataset 
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


# Inspiration
Diabetes has got many vicitms. I built this machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset  have diabetes or not. I tested my ML model with my father's details, it yielded me accurate results as expected.

# Skills Used:
1. Python3
2. Data Analysis with Numpy, Pandas
3. Data Visualization with Seaborn, Pandas, matplotlib, cufflinks
4. Sci-Kit Learn library for implementing Machine Learning Algorithms
5. ML algorithms - Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM
